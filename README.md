### Wild_Network

Wild Networks is a simple console program written in python using the scapy library. thanks to it, we can scan the WLAN for hosts and open ports and then perform several DoS attacks like:

- DHCP starvation
- Ping of Death
- Syn Flood
- SMURF attack

The program also allows you to perform a deauthentication attack to completely block a given WiFi network but you need a network card that supports monitor mode, and the program itself should be launched in a unix environment
